## Introduction 👋

This project focuses on the development of a mobile application aimed at promoting cost-effective electricity usage and preventing network overload in Swiss households. It addresses the negative effects of conventional electricity consumption, such as foreign purchases, peak loads, and expensive electricity.

## Key Topics 🔑

The key topics covered in this project are:

- **Savings Potential 💰**: The application enables users to shift their electricity usage to cheaper tariff times, resulting in lower electricity bills.
- **Economic Viability 🏢**: The app emphasizes the social responsibility of electricity providers and contributes to the stabilization and efficiency improvement of the power grid, benefiting both consumers and providers.
- **Acceptance 📱**: The app is provided free of charge to ensure broad access and adoption, promoting its widespread use.

## Scope 🌐

- The project focuses on the basic tariff system in the city of Zurich (EWZ).
- Static data is used as the basis for tariff data during the Proof of Concept (POC).
- The app is implemented as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
- User interaction with the application is not assessed due to time constraints.
- User statistics are not collected due to time constraints and revised data protection laws.

## Research Questions ❓

The project addresses the following research questions:

1. How does the tariff system in the public network of the City of Zurich (EWZ) function?
2. What publicly accessible tariff reporting systems already exist?
3. Is it possible to inform electricity consumers about current electricity tariffs via a mobile application?
4. Under what conditions does tariff reporting lead to the desired response from users?
5. Which supply system (external/internal) is best suited for the reporting system?

## Objectives and Theses 🎯

**Objective:**
The objective is to use a mobile application to encourage electricity consumers to take advantage of peak offers (low tariffs) to relieve the power supply network and save costs.

**Theses:**
A. A "tariff reporting app" can effectively utilize peak offers.
B. A "tariff reporting app" can relieve the power supply network.

## Findings 📊

The project gathered the following information regarding electricity prices in Switzerland for 2024:

- Typical household (5-room apartment, 4,500 kWh/year): 32.14 Rp./kWh (+27% from the previous year).
- Typical industrial facility (150,000 kWh/year): 29.65 Rp./kWh (+24% from the previous year).

Other information includes the composition of the electricity mix in Switzerland and details about tariff systems for both basic supply and the free market.

## Discussion 💬

The discussion section includes questions related to the application's potential impact, relevance, and contributions to decarbonization.

## Results 📈

The results section may include visual representations and data analysis, which are not provided in this README.

# Commit Messages 📝

The following section is optional. It is a good practice to write a commit message in the
following format:
```
Format:
<type>(<scope>): <subject> [<issue number>]

Example:
feat(Save Button): Implemented save button [MF-1]
```


The following types should be used:

* ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
* docs: Documentation only changes
* feat: A new feature
* fix: A bug fix
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
