# SICSMART - Smart Timer 

This project aims to develop a mobile app for Swiss households.
Not all Swiss homes have smart devices, and this app will encourage efficient electricity use to avoid network overloads, reduce reliance on costly foreign energy, and tackle peak power costs.
It will also serve as a hub for user communication and future sustainability projects.

## Details üîç

**Scope**


The scope of the project involves an examination of the basic tariff system using the example of the city of Zurich (EWZ).

For tariff data, a static database will serve as the data source within the framework of the Proof of Concept (POC).

The app will be implemented as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Due to time constraints, the actual use of the application by users will not be verified.

Additionally, because of the time constraints and in compliance with the revised Data Protection Act (DSG), no user statistics will be collected through the "App."

**Planned Features**

**User Functions**

The following are the main use cases for the Smart Timer
* The user can see in which tariff he is and how much it costs
* The user can see how much money he has saved with the help of the Smart Timer
* The user can see when the tarif will change
* The user can add devices and priorities
* The user can cancel or validate the use of the added devices

## Possible Future Extension üí°

**APIs**

Using APIs from the electricity supplier to better manage the times to use the devices.

**Time Picker**

The user should be able to pick a time slot at which he can use the devices, and the smart timer will decide what the best time is to use the device.

# Branching Model and Naming üåø

We use a simplyfied version of
the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/de/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow.

| Name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main`      | The master branch contains the production code and stores the official release history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `develop`   | The develop branch contains pre-production code and serves as an integration branch for features                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| _`feature`_ | Each new feature should reside in its branch, which can be pushed to the central repository for backup/collaboration. Feature branches use the latest develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact directly with the master branch |

</div>

As for the naming of the feature branches, we use the following convention:
`<issue-id>-<issue-name>[-<short-description>]`

# Commit Messages üìù

The following section is a must. It is a good practice to write a commit message in the
following format:

```
Format:
<type>(<scope>): <subject> [<issue number>]

Example:
feat(Save Button): Implemented save button [MF-1]
```

The following types should be used:

* ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
* docs: Documentation only changes
* feat: A new feature
* fix: A bug fix
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

_For more information, please refer to
the [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)_

# Versioning üìå
